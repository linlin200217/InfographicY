The ship was considered under capacity, as inventors estimated it would be able to carry 2,435 passengers and 900 crew members at any given time. However, there were only 20 lifeboats on the ship at this time—enough to save approximately 1,178 people. Only 705 people survived the horrific event, now considered one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. Not all survivors are created equal, though—there were some passengers aboard the Titanic who statistically had a higher chance of survival than others.",
